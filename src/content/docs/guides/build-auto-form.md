Triggers initiate your workflow. Click "Add New Trigger" and choose the type of trigger that will start the automation. In this example, we’ll use a form submission trigger.

### 6. Configure Your Trigger

Select the specific form that will activate the automation upon submission. Make sure to save your trigger settings after selecting the correct form.
