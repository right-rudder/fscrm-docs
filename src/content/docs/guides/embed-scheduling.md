Embedding an appointment calendar form on your website allows visitors to book time directly with your team, streamlining the scheduling process. Follow these steps to embed an appointment calendar form on your website using FSCRM.

### 1. Create or Select an Appointment Calendar

Navigate to the "Calendars" section on your FSCRM dashboard and select or create an appointment calendar that suits your needs.

### 2. Customize the Calendar

Set up the calendar with available time slots, appointment types, and other preferences. Customize the appearance and the form fields that visitors will fill out when booking an appointment.

### 3. Generate the Embed Code

Once your calendar is set up, generate the embed code by selecting "Integrate Calendar" and copying the provided HTML code.

### 4. Embed the Code on Your Website

Paste the embed code into the HTML of the webpage where you want the appointment calendar to appear. This is often placed on a dedicated booking page or a contact page.

### 5. Test the Appointment Booking

Visit the page to ensure that the appointment calendar is displayed correctly and test the booking process. Confirm that appointments are being scheduled correctly in FSCRM.

### 6. Save and Finalize

Save the changes on your website’s CMS and in FSCRM. Your appointment calendar form is now live and ready for bookings.

### Troubleshooting
