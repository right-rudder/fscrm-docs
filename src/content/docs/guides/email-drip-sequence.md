### 9. Link Email Event to Conditional Branch

Connect the email event to the conditional branch, dividing the contacts based on their behavior (e.g., opening or not opening the email).

### 10. Create a Follow-Up Email

For recipients who open the email, add a follow-up email to maintain engagement and guide them further down the funnel.

### 11. Send SMS for Unopened Emails

If the email remains unopened after the specified time, set up an SMS action to reach out via text message, offering an alternative way to engage the lead.

### 12. Save and Publish Your Workflow

Once you've set up your email drip sequence, save the workflow. Switch it to "Publish" mode to activate the automation, ensuring your emails start going out as planned.

By following these steps, you can create an effective email drip sequence that nurtures leads, increases engagement, and helps convert prospects into students.
