Embedding a form on your website allows you to capture leads, gather information, and engage with visitors. Here’s how to embed a form on your website using FSCRM.

## 1. Create or Select a Form

Go to the "Sites" or "Funnels" section of your FSCRM dashboard and select "Forms." Either create a new form or choose an existing one that you want to embed.

## 2. Customize the Form

Customize the form’s fields, appearance, and behavior to fit your needs. Make sure to configure any integrations or automations that should be triggered when the form is submitted.

## 3. Generate the Embed Code

After customizing the form, click on "Integrate Form" to generate the embed code. Copy the HTML code provided.

## 4. Embed the Code on Your Website

Paste the embed code into the HTML of the webpage where you want the form to appear. This could be on a landing page, contact page, or any other relevant page.

## 5. Test the Form

After embedding, visit the page to ensure the form is displaying correctly and functioning as expected. Submit a test entry to confirm that the data is captured in FSCRM.

## 6. Save and Finalize

Save the changes on your website’s CMS and in FSCRM. Your form is now live and ready to capture submissions.

## Troubleshooting

If the form does not appear or function correctly, check that:
- The embed code is placed correctly within your website’s HTML.
- The form fields are mapped correctly in FSCRM.
- Any necessary scripts are loaded on your website.
