The Bulk Import CSV feature in FSCRM lets you quickly import large numbers of contacts from an external CSV file into your CRM system. This is especially useful for migrating data from another platform or updating contact information in bulk.

### 1. Locate the Import Contacts Button

Start by navigating to the "Contacts" section from the sidebar menu on your FSCRM dashboard. Within the Contacts section, find and click the "Import Contacts" button to start the import process.

### 3. Verify CSV Formatting


Before proceeding, ensure that your CSV file is properly formatted. The file should be organized into columns and rows, with each row representing a separate contact entry. Double-check that the data aligns with FSCRM’s required specifications.

### 4. Map CSV Fields to FSCRM Fields

Next, map the fields from your CSV file to the corresponding fields in FSCRM. This step is crucial for ensuring accurate data import. If your CSV contains fields that don’t directly match those in FSCRM, consider creating [custom fields](/guides/custom-fields) to accommodate the additional data.

### 5. Choose a Separate Contact List (Optional)

You have the option to create a separate list for the contacts you’re importing. This is useful for organizing and managing the newly imported contacts more efficiently.
