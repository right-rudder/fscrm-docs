# Bulk Import CSV of Contacts

The Bulk Import CSV of Contacts feature in FSCRM allows flight schools to efficiently import a large number of contacts into the CRM system from an external CSV file. This feature is particularly useful when migrating data from another system or when updating contact information in bulk.

## 1. Navigate to the Contacts Section:
Access the "Contacts" section on the sidebar menu of your FSCRM dashboard.

## 2. Find the Import Contacts Button:
Locate and click on the "Import Contacts" button within the Contacts section to initiate the import process.

## 4. Ensure Proper CSV Formatting:
Before proceeding, double-check that your CSV file is properly formatted according to the required specifications. Ensure that the data is organized into columns and rows, with each row representing a separate contact entry.

## 5. Map Fields from CSV to FSCRM:
Map the fields in your CSV file with the corresponding fields in the FSCRM system. This step ensures accurate data import. Create [custom fields] (custom field feature) if your CSV contains fields not directly matching those in FSCRM.
