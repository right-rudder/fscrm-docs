Setting up email integration in FSCRM allows you to send, receive, and track emails directly from your CRM platform. Follow these steps to integrate your email account with FSCRM.

### 1. Access the Email Settings

Go to the "Settings" section of your FSCRM dashboard and navigate to "Email Settings" or "SMTP/IMAP."

### 2. Connect Your Email Account

Choose your email provider from the list (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo). Enter your email address, password, and any other required credentials. FSCRM will use these to connect to your email account.

### 3. Configure SMTP/IMAP Settings

If prompted, enter your SMTP and IMAP server settings. These details are usually provided by your email service provider and are necessary for FSCRM to send and receive emails.

### 4. Test the Connection

After entering your credentials and server settings, test the connection to ensure everything is configured correctly. FSCRM will attempt to send a test email to confirm the setup.

### 5. Set Up Email Signatures and Templates

Once your email is connected, create custom email signatures and templates for consistency in your communications. These can be accessed and used whenever you send an email from FSCRM.

### 6. Save and Finalize

Save your email settings. Your email integration is now active, and you can manage all email communications directly from FSCRM.

### Troubleshooting

If emails arenâ€™t sending or receiving, ensure that:
- The SMTP/IMAP settings are correct.
- Your email credentials are up to date.
- There are no firewall or security settings blocking FSCRM.
