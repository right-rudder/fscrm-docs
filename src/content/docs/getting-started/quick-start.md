---

We're going to be going over the steps to set up FSCRM at your flight school.  The main steps are

1. **Complete Onboarding** Get usernames and passwords setup for your team.  Get email and phone setup in the CRM.
2. **Build a Pipeline** Create and mirror your sales process in the CRM
3. **Import Contacts** Load up your contacts into the CRM
4. **Integrate Forms** String up your website to the CRM and have leads from your website flow into the CRM
5. **Create Automations** Draft up necessary automated emails to nurture your leads and alleviate workload on your team.

## Complete Onboarding

To get started with FSCRM, you'll need to schedule an onboarding call with one of our team members.  On this call we will do the following:

### 1. **User Setup:**
   - Collect team info for usernames and passwords.
   - Set up user accounts in the CRM.

### 2. **Technical Setup:**
   - Our team will help setup [subdomains](/guides/setup-subdomain), [phone system](/guides/setup-phone-system), and [SMTP](guides/setup-email) (email) if you've purchased our setup service.  If not, we will direct you to the necessary resources where you can do it yourself and also answer any additional questions on the call.

### 3. **Team Training:**
   - This would be the time where we help teach your team on how to use the CRM and also answer any additional questions on how to best use the CRM for your use case.


Get through onboarding for a smooth integration of FSCRM into your flight school's operations.  This onboarding call will be scheduled after you've paid and signed the service agreement


## Build a Pipeline

A pipeline is your visual representation of where all of your leads are in the sales process.  Most flight schools have some version of the following sales process.

1. **Inbound lead** Whether it's a walk-in, a phone call, or form submission; you obtain a potential student pilot's contact information.  From here, the core objective of your sales team is to get this person to come to your school and do a discovery flight, tour your flight school, and meet your team and fellow students.

2. **Discovery Flight** This is where you'll place leads that have a visit to your flight school scheduled.  At this point, ideally, you're sending them information between now and the time they visit to "prep" them for the visit.  This can be marketing material like downloadable PDFs, links to blog posts and articles, or videos of testimonials of past successful students.

3. **Follow Up** After a discover flight, there are three outcomes.
    1. They hate it.  Flying isn't right for them (at least at this time)
    2. They love it, but they haven't committed to a start date or getting on the schedule.
    3. They love it, and they're ready to start training.

    If it's outcome 1, that means you're going to consider it a no-go and remove them from the pipeline.  They will still be in your CRM though so you can continue to nurture this lead with newsletters and communication from your flight school.  

    If it's outcome 2, you're going to put the lead into this stage.  At this point, you'll want to have one of your team members follow up with this lead to ensure the lead is taking steps to start pilot training soon.  Whether it's securing financing, completing paperwork, or enrolling in ground school; you need to keep the communication rhythm going and **follow up** with them.

    If it's outcome 3, you're going to remove them from the pipeline and categorize them as a won opportunity.  They will still be in the CRM and receive newsletters and communication from your flight school.  Congrats! You have a new student at your flight school.

Building the pipeline infrastructure is crucial as it documents your sale process via the CRM dashboard.  This is just a brief overview of how to build the pipeline.  For specific technical steps, visit the [pipeline](/features/pipeline) and the [opportunities](/features/opportunities).

## Import Contacts

Now that your settings are configured from onboarding and your pipeline is created, the next step is to import all of your contacts into the CRM.  FSCRM makes it easy to import your contact database via [bulk import of CSV contacts](/guides/bulk-import-contacts/).
