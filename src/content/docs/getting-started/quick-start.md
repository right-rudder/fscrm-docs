---

We're going to be going over the steps to set up FSCRM at your flight school. The main steps are:

1. **Complete Onboarding**: Get usernames and passwords set up for your team. Get email and phone setup in the CRM.
2. **Build a Pipeline**: Create and mirror your sales process in the CRM.
3. **Import Contacts**: Load up your contacts into the CRM.
4. **Integrate Forms**: Link your website to the CRM and have leads from your website flow into the CRM.
5. **Create Automations**: Draft necessary automated emails to nurture your leads and alleviate workload on your team.

## Complete Onboarding

To get started with FSCRM, you'll need to [schedule an onboarding call](https://rightruddermarketing.com/schedule-call) with one of our team members. On this call, we will do the following:

### 1. **User Setup:**
   - Collect team info for usernames and passwords.
   - Set up user accounts in the CRM.

### 2. **Technical Setup:**
   - Our team will help set up [subdomains](/guides/setup-subdomain), [phone system](/guides/setup-phone-system), and [SMTP](/guides/setup-email) (email) if you've purchased our setup service. If not, we will direct you to the necessary resources where you can do it yourself and also answer any additional questions on the call.

### 3. **Team Training:**
   - This is when we help train your team on how to use the CRM and also answer any additional questions on how to best use the CRM for your use case.

Get through onboarding for a smooth integration of FSCRM into your flight school's operations. This onboarding call will be scheduled after you've paid and signed the service agreement.

## Build a Pipeline

A pipeline is your visual representation of where all of your leads are in the sales process. Most flight schools have some version of the following sales process.

### 1. **Inbound Lead**

Whether it's a walk-in, a phone call, or form submission; you obtain a potential student pilot's contact information. From here, the core objective of your sales team is to get this person to come to your school, do a discovery flight, tour your flight school, and meet your team and fellow students.

### 2. **Discovery Flight**

This is where you'll place leads that have a visit to your flight school scheduled. At this point, ideally, you're sending them information between now and the time they visit to "prep" them for the visit. This can be marketing material like downloadable PDFs, links to blog posts and articles, or videos of testimonials from past successful students.

### 3. **Follow Up**

After a discovery flight, there are three outcomes:

1. **They aren't interested**: Flying isn't right for them (at least at this time).
2. **They are interested but haven't committed**: They love it, but they haven't committed to a start date or getting on the schedule.
3. **They are ready to start**: They love it, and they're ready to start training.

If it's outcome 1, you'll consider it a no-go and remove them from the pipeline. They will still be in your CRM though, so you can continue to nurture this lead with newsletters and communication from your flight school.

If it's outcome 2, you'll put the lead into this stage. At this point, you'll want to have one of your team members follow up with this lead to ensure they are taking steps to start pilot training soon. Whether it's securing financing, completing paperwork, or enrolling in ground school; you need to keep the communication rhythm going and **follow up** with them.

If it's outcome 3, you'll remove them from the pipeline and categorize them as a won opportunity. They will still be in the CRM and receive newsletters and communication from your flight school. Congrats! You have a new student at your flight school.

Building the pipeline infrastructure is crucial as it documents your sales process via the CRM dashboard. This is just a brief overview of how to build the pipeline. For specific technical steps, visit the [pipeline](/features/pipeline) and the [opportunities](/features/opportunities) guides.

## Import Contacts

Now that your settings are configured from onboarding and your pipeline is created, the next step is to import all of your contacts into the CRM. FSCRM makes it easy to import your contact database via [bulk import of CSV contacts](/guides/bulk-import-contacts).

## Integrate Forms


Integrating forms with FSCRM allows you to capture leads directly from your website and automatically funnel them into your CRM. This integration ensures that no leads slip through the cracks and that your team can promptly follow up with each inquiry.

### 1. **Create or Select a Form**

Navigate to the "Forms" section in FSCRM and either create a new form or choose an existing one that you want to integrate with your website.

### 2. **Customize Your Form**

Tailor the form fields to capture the necessary information from your leads. Ensure that the form is user-friendly and aligns with the design of your website.

### 3. **Generate the Embed Code**

After customizing your form, generate the embed code by clicking "Integrate Form." Copy the provided HTML code.

### 4. **Embed the Form on Your Website**

Paste the embed code into the HTML of your website where you want the form to appear. This could be on a landing page, contact page, or any relevant section.

### 5. **Test the Form Integration**

Visit your website to ensure the form is displayed correctly and that submissions are being captured in FSCRM.

For detailed instructions on form integration, check out the [embed a form on your website guide](/guides/embed-form).

## Create Automations

Automations in FSCRM are powerful tools that help you nurture leads, follow up on opportunities, and reduce manual workload for your team.

### 1. **Access the Automations Tab**

Navigate to the "Automations" tab in FSCRM to start creating workflows.

### 2. **Choose a Workflow**

Select a pre-built workflow or create a custom one that suits your needs. Automations can be set up for various tasks such as sending follow-up emails, updating contact information, or moving leads through the sales pipeline.

### 3. **Configure Triggers and Actions**

Set triggers that will start the automation, such as form submissions or specific lead actions. Then, configure the actions that should happen once the trigger is activated, like sending an email or updating a leadâ€™s status.

### 4. **Test and Activate the Automation**

Once your automation is set up, test it to ensure it works as expected. Then, activate it to start streamlining your processes.
