Frequently asked questions and answers regarding the use of Flight School CRM.

## FAQs

### What is a CRM?
A CRM, or Customer Relationship Management system, is a software solution designed to help businesses manage and optimize their interactions with customers and clients. For flight schools this means giving your team the tools they need to keep track of prospective student pilots and nurture those leads to become student pilots at your school.  This is done in the form of features that are bundled into the software which include:


1. **Lead and Inquiry Management:** Flight schools often deal with inquiries from potential students. A CRM helps in capturing, organizing, and following up on leads, ensuring that no prospective students are overlooked and that communication is consistent.

2. **Sales team enhancement:** Effective communication between management, team members, and administrative staff is vital. A CRM facilitates seamless communication through features like tasks, notifications, automatic email sends, and centralized communication logs.

7. **Data Analysis and Reporting:** CRM systems provide valuable insights through analytics and reporting tools. Flight schools can leverage this data to identify trends, assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, and make informed decisions for continuous improvement.

9. **Customer Retention:** Many flight schools do not capitalize on digital marketing and CRM software to keep student pilots engaged and active in your community and rely solely day to day interactions with their customers to keep student pilots.  Using a CRM helps provide consistent updates about your business to your customers.

10. **Touching the Rolodex:** CRMs are the modern equivalent of a Rolodex.  FSCRM offers multiple methods of reaching out to active and inactive students.  Whether through emails, phone, or text; you can keep track of the communication history and notes to build a vibrant community around your flight school.


### How do CRMs help grow flight school businesses?

Many flight schools rely solely on excel sheets and sticky notes.  While this works for a while, as your flight school scales and more employees are brought into your team, having a CRM helps manage all of those inquiries to ensure you're receiving the most posable amount of revenue.

In addition to tracking leads and storing contact information, having a CRM helps identify what part in your sales pipeline needs more attention.

### How many user accounts are allowed?  Can I have multiple user accounts?

There are no limits on number of users.  You can create user accounts for your entire team if you'd like, or just limit it to your front desk and admin team.

### How do I get started and setup an account?

Please schedule an onboarding call [here](https://flightschoolcrm.com/contact).  A Right Rudder Marketing team member will set up your account and credentials.

## Is FSCRM a scheduler?

FSCRM has calendar functionalities but is not intended to be a replacement for flight school scheduler software.  The calendar functionality can be used to set appointments or tours to your flight school, but we do recommend against using the software to manage your scheduling.
