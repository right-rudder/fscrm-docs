Frequently asked questions and answers regarding the use of Flight School CRM.

## FAQs

### What is a CRM?
A CRM, or Customer Relationship Management system, is a software solution designed to help businesses manage and optimize their interactions with customers and clients. For flight school this means giving your team the tools they need to keep track of prospective student pilots and nurture those leads to become student pilots at your school.  This is done in the form of features that are bundled into the software which include:


1. **Lead and Inquiry Management:** Flight schools often deal with inquiries from potential students. A CRM helps in capturing, organizing, and following up on leads, ensuring that no prospective students are overlooked and that communication is consistent.

2. **Sales team enhancement:** Effective communication between management, team members, and administrative staff is vital. A CRM facilitates seamless communication through features like teaks, notifications, automatic email sends, and centralized communication logs.

7. **Data Analysis and Reporting:** CRM systems provide valuable insights through analytics and reporting tools. Flight schools can leverage this data to identify trends, assess the effectiveness of training programs, and make informed decisions for continuous improvement.

9. **Customer Retention:** Besides working one on one with your CFIs and walking though the front door and talking to your administrative staff, many flight schools do not capitalize on digital marketing to keep student pilots engaged and active in your community.

10. **Touch the Rolodex:** A CRM platform offers multiple methods of reaching out to active and inactive students.  Whether through emails, phone, or text; you can keep track of the communication history and notes to build a vibrant community around your flight school.
