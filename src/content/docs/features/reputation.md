The Reputation Management feature in FSCRM allows you to actively monitor and manage your flight school’s online reputation. Request and track reviews from students across platforms like Google, Yelp, and Facebook, ensuring a steady stream of feedback from satisfied clients.

This feature also enables you to respond to reviews directly from within the CRM, helping you maintain a positive online presence and address any concerns promptly. Optional AI-generated responses can save time while maintaining a professional tone, though manual input is always available for more personalized interactions.
