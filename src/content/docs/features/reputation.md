The Reputation Management feature in FSCRM provides flight schools with a centralized platform to actively manage their online reputation by soliciting, monitoring, and responding to reviews directly from the CRM. Flight schools can request students to leave reviews through personalized email campaigns or automated prompts, ensuring a steady stream of feedback from satisfied customers.

Within the Reputation Management dashboard, flight schools can easily track and monitor incoming reviews from various online platforms, including Google, Yelp, and Facebook. This allows them to stay informed about their overall reputation and promptly address any negative feedback or concerns raised by students.

Moreover, flight schools can leverage FSCRM's AI responder functionality to automatically generate personalized responses to reviews, saving time and effort while maintaining a professional and consistent tone. Although this feature is optional and disabled by default, it offers an efficient way to engage with reviewers and demonstrate proactive customer service.
