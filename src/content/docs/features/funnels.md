The Funnels feature in FSCRM allows you to create step-by-step or page-by-page flows that guide leads through form submissions, appointment bookings, or simply displaying important information. This tool enables you to design tailored paths that maximize engagement, helping prospects navigate their journey from initial interest to enrollment.

By tracking and analyzing funnel performance, you can refine these flows to improve conversion rates and ensure that leads are effectively nurtured at every stage of their journey.
