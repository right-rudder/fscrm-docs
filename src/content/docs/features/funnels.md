description: About the Funnels feature.

Funnels are used for managing and optimizing the student acquisition journey by streamlining form submissions and guiding prospects through a series of targeted actions. Similar to workflows, Funnels allow users to design and automate sequential processes based on form submissions, enabling seamless navigation and interaction with prospects at every stage of the enrollment process.

With Funnels, flight schools can create customized pathways or "funnels" that map out the desired user journey from initial inquiry to enrollment. Users can define specific actions or steps for each funnel, such as redirecting users to follow-up forms, presenting relevant offers or resources, or guiding them to specific sections of the website based on their responses.

Flight schools can create multiple funnels tailored to different audience segments, campaign objectives, or stages of the enrollment process, allowing for targeted and personalized engagement with prospects. Funnels provide flight schools with valuable insights into user behavior and engagement, allowing them to track and analyze the effectiveness of different funnel paths, identify bottlenecks or drop-off points, and optimize the user experience for maximum conversion.
