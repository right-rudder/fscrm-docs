The Opportunities feature in FSCRM is the central hub for tracking and managing the progress of your leads as they move through the enrollment process. This is where you can monitor every critical aspect of your leads, from their current stage in the pipeline to their potential value and origin.

With Opportunities, you can:

- **Track Lead Progress:** Clearly see where each lead is in their journey toward becoming a student, from initial inquiry to final enrollment. This visibility allows you to focus your efforts on nurturing leads that are close to conversion.
- **Assess Lead Value:** Each opportunity can be assigned a potential value, helping you prioritize your efforts on the leads that are most beneficial to your flight school.
- **Identify Lead Source:** Easily track where your leads are coming from, whether it’s a specific marketing campaign, referral, or organic traffic. This helps you understand which channels are most effective in driving new business.
- **Monitor Pipeline Volume:** The Opportunities feature provides a comprehensive view of your entire sales pipeline, allowing you to see the volume of leads at each stage. This helps you anticipate future enrollment numbers and manage your resources accordingly.

Right Rudder Marketing (RRM) recommends funneling all leads into the Opportunities feature for a streamlined, easy-to-manage view of who needs nurturing. This centralized approach ensures that no lead is overlooked and that your team can focus on guiding prospects toward becoming enrolled students.
