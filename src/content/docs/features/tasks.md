Use Tasks as a collaborative tool to facilitate communication and assign work effectively among team members. With this feature, flight school administrators and staff can create, assign, and track tasks related to various aspects of operations, ensuring that key responsibilities are managed efficiently and deadlines are met consistently.

Administrators can create tasks for specific team members, outlining the details, deadlines, and priorities associated with each assignment. By assigning tasks directly within the CRM platform, flight school staff can easily access their assigned responsibilities, track progress, and stay organized without the need for external task management tools or email chains.

Additionally, the Tasks feature enables flight school administrators to set priorities and deadlines for each task, ensuring that important initiatives and projects are completed promptly. By establishing clear timelines and expectations, flight school teams can prioritize their workload effectively, allocate resources efficiently, and prevent tasks from falling through the cracks.
