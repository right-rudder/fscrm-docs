Integrating iCloud Calendar with FSCRM allows you to synchronize your schedules, manage appointments, and ensure that all your calendar events are accessible from one platform. This guide will walk you through the steps to connect iCloud Calendar to FSCRM.

### 1. Access the Integrations Section

Navigate to the "Integrations" tab on the sidebar of your FSCRM dashboard.

### 2. Find iCloud Calendar Integration

Scroll through the list of available integrations until you find "iCloud Calendar." Click on it to begin the integration process.

### 3. Connect Your iCloud Account

Click on "Connect" to link your iCloud account. You’ll be prompted to sign in to your Apple ID and grant FSCRM permission to access your calendar.

### 4. Choose Calendar Settings

Once your iCloud account is connected, select which calendar(s) you want to sync with FSCRM. You can choose to sync all calendars or specific ones depending on your needs.

### 5. Configure Sync Preferences

Set your synchronization preferences. You can choose to sync events from FSCRM to iCloud Calendar, from iCloud Calendar to FSCRM, or both ways. Decide how frequently the sync should occur (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly).

### 6. Test the Integration

After configuring your settings, test the integration by creating an event in either FSCRM or iCloud Calendar. Verify that the event appears in both platforms as expected.

### 7. Save and Finalize

Once you’ve confirmed that everything is working correctly, save your settings. Your iCloud Calendar is now fully integrated with FSCRM, allowing for seamless scheduling and event management.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the integration, ensure that:
- Your iCloud account has proper permissions set for calendar access.
- The calendars you want to sync are selected in both FSCRM and iCloud Calendar.
- You have an active internet connection during the sync process.
