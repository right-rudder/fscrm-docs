### 1. Access the Integrations Section

Set your synchronization preferences. You can choose to sync events from FSCRM to Outlook Calendar, from Outlook Calendar to FSCRM, or both ways. Decide how frequently the sync should occur (e.g., every 15 minutes, hourly).

### 6. Test the Integration

After configuring your settings, test the integration by creating an event in either FSCRM or Outlook Calendar. Verify that the event appears in both platforms as expected.

### 7. Save and Finalize
