#### *Coming Soon*
Integrating Zapier with FSCRM allows you to automate workflows and connect FSCRM with thousands of other apps. This guide will walk you through the steps to connect Zapier to FSCRM.

### 1. Access the Integrations Section

Navigate to the "Integrations" tab on the sidebar of your FSCRM dashboard.

### 2. Find Zapier Integration

Scroll through the list of available integrations until you find "Zapier." Click on it to begin the integration process.

### 3. Sign in to Your Zapier Account

Click on "Connect" to link your Zapier account. You’ll be prompted to sign in to your Zapier account and authorize FSCRM to access your Zaps.

### 4. Create a New Zap

Once connected, create a new Zap in your Zapier account that will trigger an action in FSCRM. For example, you might set up a Zap that triggers when a new lead is added to your CRM.

### 5. Choose an Action in FSCRM

In your new Zap, select the action that should occur in FSCRM when the trigger is activated. This could be creating a new contact, sending an email, or updating an opportunity.

### 6. Test the Zap

Test your Zap to ensure that it triggers the desired action in FSCRM. For example, if your Zap creates a new contact, check FSCRM to verify that the contact was added successfully.

### 7. Save and Finalize

Once you’ve confirmed that everything is working correctly, save your settings. Your Zapier integration is now fully operational with FSCRM, allowing for enhanced automation and connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the integration, ensure that:
- Your Zapier account is active and has the correct permissions.
- The correct Zap triggers and actions are selected in both Zapier and FSCRM.
- You have an active internet connection during the integration process.
